# LichessClient

A typed, async Swift client for the public Lichess HTTP API.

## Overview

Swiftâ€‘Lichess wraps the generated bindings from the official Lichess OpenAPI
specification with a small, ergonomic surface that feels at home in Swift.

- 100% endpoint coverage via generated bindings and thin wrappers
- Async/await, `HTTPBody` streams, and strict concurrency
- Pluggable middlewares for logging, retries, rate limiting, auth, and more

Create a client with default settings using ``LichessClient/init()`` or provide
custom ``LichessClient/Configuration`` to tailor transport, headers, policies,
and authentication.

### Quick Start

```swift
import LichessClient

let client = LichessClient()
let user = try await client.getUser(username: "thibault")
print(user.username)
```
